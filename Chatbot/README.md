## How It Works

1. **User Login**: Enter your Hugging Face email and password in the sidebar to authenticate. This step is necessary to access the HugChat service.

2. **Chat Interface**: Once authenticated, you can enter your message in the chat input field. The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

3. **Generate Response**: When you submit a message, the application sends your prompt to HugChat. The chatbot processes your input and generates an appropriate response.

4. **Display Messages**: The application displays both your messages and the chatbot's responses in a chat format, providing an interactive and engaging experience.

5. **Session Management**: The application uses session state to keep track of the conversation, ensuring that all messages are preserved and displayed correctly during your interaction with the chatbot.
