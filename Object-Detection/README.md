# Object Detection

This is a simple Streamlit object detection application that uses a pre-trained MobileNetSSD model to detect objects in images.

## Features

- Upload images for object detection
- Display detected objects with bounding boxes
- Interactive user interface for uploading and processing images

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pre-trained MobileNetSSD model files

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Upload an image file (JPG, PNG, JPEG) through the interface. The application accepts image files and processes them to detect objects.

2. **Process Image**: The application uses OpenCV and the MobileNetSSD model to process the uploaded image and identify objects within it.

3. **Display Results**: The application displays the uploaded image with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects, providing a visual representation of the detection results.

4. **Interactive Interface**: The interface allows users to easily upload images and view detection results in real-time.
